# Privacy and Security in IoT

We will go through an overview of security and privacy challenges that must be faced and solved when creating new Things for the Internet of Things. We will discuss why are Things inherently insecure together with examples of attack vectors and learn some risk mitigation strategies. We will realize why should users be wary of Things violating their privacy and will gain awareness of upcoming EU privacy legislation that affects providers of IoT-based solutions.
